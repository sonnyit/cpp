## Naming [&#10548;](#tables)

The name of a variable, function, type, or other kind of object in C++ is called an identifier. C++ gives you a lot of flexibility to name identifiers as you wish. However, there are a few rules that must be followed when naming identifiers:

* The identifier can not be a keyword. Keywords are reserved.
* The identifier can only be composed of letters (lower or upper case), numbers, and the underscore character. That means the name can not contain symbols (except the underscore) nor whitespace (spaces or tabs).
* The identifier must begin with a letter (lower or upper case) or an underscore. It can not start with a number.
* C++ distinguishes between lower and upper case letters. nvalue is different than nValue is different than NVALUE.
